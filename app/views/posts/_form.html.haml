Tell us what city or town this happened in, the name of the area, the street name, and finally the postcode. if you can't remember some of the details or are unsure of the area, try clicking our map button and using a pointer to tell us where it happened.

It is only since I found a charity that can help me with this type of experience that I feel able to come forward about this ordeal.  I decided not to press charges because I didn't want the process to be similar to how I was treated in the police station.  I think if more woman are treated this way then less will come forward with reports on assaults."

I think a station should have someone on at all times who can deal with someone like me who has gone through an experience similar to mine.

                These are just descriptive words that help to categorise your story ( kind of like internet bookmarks ). For example, if your story is about a burglary at your house you might use the tags, burglary, theft, home, criminal, lost.
