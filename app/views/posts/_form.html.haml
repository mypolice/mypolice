              I think the UK definitely needs more police. I was brought up in London during the 1960s & vividly remember seeing a "bobby on the beat". Yes there was crime but there was a moral code. People respected the police. I can't remember the last time I seen a police officer walking down my street. There must be a way we can police back out on the streets!

              "I have to admit that we're not able to do this sort of thing very often due to the large areas that we now have to cover, all the targets we have to meet and ticky boxes we have to fill in. We basically don't have much time to walk. I have answered a similar question before. I'm told that the government is looking to reduce bureaucracy in the Police but I've heard that many times before and nothing changes. It remains to be seen.
              %br/
              That said though, I as are many of my colleagues, am happy to go out walking when the opportunity arises and have previously done so many times.
              %br/
              A question for the asker though would be 'When did you last see a plain clothes officer walk or drive down your street?'
              %br/
              Just because we aren't wearing silly high glo coats and in marked Police cars, it doesn't mean we aren't there. What you also have to bear in mind is that we are patrolling the streets whilst you are sleeping."

              A character is a written symbol, a letter,  that is used to represent speech; "the Greek alphabet has 24 characters
          ). More than 140 characters would be great.

              I would like to see your staff trained more to deal with this type of situation and perhaps a special number I can phone before I go, or some kind of way for me to meet up with someone to report the assault without having to visit the station.  I think a station should have someone on at all times who can deal with someone like me who has gone through an experience similar to mine.

              These are just descriptive words that help to categorise your story ( kind of like internet bookmarks ). For example, if your story is about a burglary at your house you might use the tags, burglary, theft, home, criminal, lost.
